# api-endpoint
This app is a project that builds backend APIs using Node and Express. The app uses http protocols to do transactions with the backend. It uses a series of calls like Get, Post, Put and Delete 
with an HTML address to transact with the backend and the mongodb database. When the frontend needs to make a transaction with the backend, it makes a call with an api endpoint that looks like
an html url. The api then response with success or failure with data if need be. The Api end-points are tested with POSTMAN.
